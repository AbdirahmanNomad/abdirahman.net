Generate, validate, and enrich phone numbers for all 8 Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, Åland Islands). Powered by Google's libphonenumber with 395+ cities covered.

I built this Nordic phone number API because I noticed there wasn't a good unified solution for handling phone numbers across all the Nordic countries. While working on projects that served users in Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and other Nordic countries, I kept having to integrate different validation logic for each country, which was time-consuming and error-prone.

So I created this API that covers all 8 Nordic countries - Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Greenland, Faroe Islands, and Åland Islands. I powered it with Google's libphonenumber library, which is the gold standard for phone number validation and formatting. This means you get the same level of accuracy and reliability that Google uses in their own products.

One feature I'm particularly happy with is the extensive city coverage - 395+ cities are supported, which means you can not only validate a phone number but also figure out which city or region it belongs to. This is useful for everything from user registration forms to market analysis and demographic research.

The API can generate valid phone numbers for testing, validate numbers according to each country's specific rules, identify carriers, and format numbers according to local standards. Whether you're building a contact form for a Nordic business, validating user phone numbers in a registration flow, or analyzing phone number data, this API handles all the complexity of dealing with different Nordic numbering systems.
