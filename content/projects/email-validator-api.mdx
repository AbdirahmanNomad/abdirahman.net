Professional email validation API with format, domain, MX records, disposable email detection, role-based detection, risk scoring, and deliverability confidence.

I created this email validation API to help developers and businesses ensure the quality of their email databases. Whether you're building a signup form, cleaning your mailing list, or verifying customer data, this API helps you catch invalid emails before they cause problems.

The API checks everything from basic format validation to more advanced features like MX record verification. It can detect disposable email addresses, identify role-based emails like admin@company.com or support@company.com, and even provide risk scores and deliverability confidence ratings. This means you can make smarter decisions about which emails to accept, which to flag for review, and which to reject outright.

One thing I'm particularly proud of is how it handles MX records - instead of just checking if an email looks valid, it actually verifies that the domain can receive mail. This catches a lot of issues that simple format validation would miss.
