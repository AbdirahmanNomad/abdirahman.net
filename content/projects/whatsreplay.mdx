Rediscover history, one headline at a time. Explore fascinating moments from history with our interactive historical events viewer. Discover what happened on this day in the past or find random interesting events that shaped our world.

I created WhatsReplay because I've always been fascinated by history and how events from the past continue to shape our world today. I wanted to build something that makes history accessible and engaging, not just a dry list of dates and facts. The idea came from wondering "what happened on this day in history?" and realizing there wasn't a great interactive way to explore historical events in an engaging way.

So I built WhatsReplay - an interactive historical events viewer that lets you explore fascinating moments from history. Whether you're curious about what happened on this day in the past, or you just want to discover random interesting events that shaped our world, the platform brings history to life with captivating stories from across the centuries.

From groundbreaking inventions to pivotal political moments, from wars and conflicts to discoveries and science, from arts and culture to society and rights - WhatsReplay covers it all. I added filtering by theme so you can explore specific types of historical events, whether you're interested in wars and conflicts, discoveries and science, politics and government, arts and culture, society and rights, royalty and nobility, or exploration and discovery.

The "This Day in History" feature lets you see what significant events happened on any date throughout history, while the "Random Event" feature helps you discover interesting moments you might never have heard of. Each event includes details about when it happened, what category it falls into, and why it was significant.

The goal was to make history more than just memorizing dates - I wanted to create something that helps people rediscover history, one headline at a time, and understand how these events connect to our world today.
