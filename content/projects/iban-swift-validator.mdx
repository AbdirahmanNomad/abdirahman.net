Professional IBAN & SWIFT validation API with 51,000+ banks across 204 countries. ISO 13616 compliant validation, bulk processing (1,000 IBANs), CSV upload (10,000 rows), fraud detection, risk scoring, and comprehensive bank lookup. Perfect for fintech, payment processing, and enterprise applications.

I built this IBAN and SWIFT validator API because I kept running into the same problem - validating bank account numbers across different countries is surprisingly complicated. Each country has its own format, different validation rules, and keeping track of which bank codes are valid is a nightmare.

So I created this API that covers 51,000+ banks across 204 countries. It's ISO 13616 compliant, which means it follows the international standard for IBAN validation. But I didn't stop there - I added features like bulk processing so you can validate up to 1,000 IBANs at once, CSV upload support for handling up to 10,000 rows, fraud detection to catch suspicious patterns, and risk scoring to help you make better decisions about which transactions to process.

One of the things I'm most proud of is the comprehensive bank lookup feature. When you validate an IBAN, you get detailed information about the bank, its SWIFT code, and where it's located. This makes it perfect for fintech applications, payment processing systems, and enterprise applications where you need more than just a simple valid/invalid response.

The fraud detection and risk scoring features came from seeing how many bad actors try to use invalid or suspicious bank accounts. The API helps catch these before they cause problems, saving time and money for businesses that rely on it.
