Advanced DNA analysis platform with machine learning predictions, lab integration, and comprehensive health insights.

I created this DNA Analysis System because I wanted to make personalized healthcare accessible and actionable. Traditional genetic testing services are expensive and often don't provide comprehensive insights about what your DNA actually means for your health, medications, and overall wellbeing.

So I built a professional DNA genomics suite that goes far beyond basic genetic reports. The system analyzes 609,424+ genetic variants across all 23 chromosomes, providing insights into disease risks, medication compatibility, nutrient metabolism, ancestry, and even athletic performance potential.

The core analysis includes 32 disease risk scores using polygenic risk scores for major conditions, 19 drug response profiles based on pharmacogenomics with FDA and CPIC guidelines, 15+ nutrient metabolism insights for personalized nutrition recommendations, maternal and paternal ancestry and haplogroup information, and athletic performance genetics covering endurance, power, and recovery potential.

One feature I'm particularly proud of is the lab results integration. Users can upload CSV lab results for advanced analysis. The system uses machine learning predictions with XGBoost, Bayesian, and LSTM ensemble models to provide 90-day health forecasts with confidence intervals. It correlates genetic findings with lab results to explain why certain values might be abnormal, provides combined risk assessments that consider both DNA and current health status, and performs trend analysis across multiple measurements over time.

The machine learning component is what makes this system powerful - it doesn't just tell you what your genes say, it predicts what's likely to happen with your health and how your genetics interact with your current health status. The forecasts help users and healthcare providers make proactive decisions about preventive care and treatment.

The export and reporting features ensure that all this information is accessible and actionable. The system generates comprehensive PDF reports of 50-100 pages that include all genetic findings, lab results summaries, ML predictions with visual charts, combined risk assessments, and personalized action plans. Users can also export their data in CSV or JSON formats and easily share reports with healthcare providers.

The goal is to empower people with deep, actionable insights about their genetic makeup. By combining DNA analysis with lab results and using machine learning to predict future health outcomes, the system helps users understand not just what their genes say, but what it means for their health today and in the future. This makes personalized medicine more accessible and helps people work more effectively with their healthcare providers to make informed decisions about their health.
