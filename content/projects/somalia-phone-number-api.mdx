The ONLY comprehensive phone number API covering ALL 10 Somali telecom operators + landline regions. Generate, validate, and analyze Somali phone numbers with carrier lookup (MCC/MNC) and CSV export.

I created this Somalia phone number API because I couldn't find any good solution for validating Somali phone numbers. Most APIs either don't support Somalia at all, or they have incomplete coverage that misses entire telecom operators. As someone who works with Somali businesses and developers, this was frustrating.

So I decided to build the ONLY comprehensive phone number API that covers ALL 10 Somali telecom operators plus all the landline regions. It wasn't easy - I had to research each operator, understand their numbering plans, figure out which mobile network codes (MCC/MNC) they use, and map out all the landline regions across different parts of Somalia.

Now the API can generate valid Somali phone numbers for testing, validate both mobile and landline numbers, identify which carrier a number belongs to, and even export results to CSV for bulk processing. The carrier lookup uses MCC/MNC codes, which is the standard way mobile networks identify themselves globally.

Whether you're building a registration form for a Somali business, validating customer phone numbers, or analyzing telecom data, this API handles all the complexity so you don't have to.
