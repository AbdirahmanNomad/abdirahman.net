Professional security testing framework with 77 total tools (43 scanners + 30 utilities + 4 advanced modules). 120 powerful scripts covering web applications, mobile apps (APK/IPA), and password security. 36 built-in scanners plus 7 external integrations.

I created the Warya Security Suite because I saw a gap in security testing tools - most solutions are either too expensive for independent researchers, too complex for beginners, or too limited in scope to be truly useful. I wanted to build a comprehensive, open-source security testing framework that brings together all the tools a security professional needs in one place.

So I built this massive security testing framework with 77 total tools. The suite includes 43 scanners (36 built-in + 7 external integrations) covering everything from web application vulnerabilities to mobile app security. It includes 30 professional utilities for common security tasks, and 4 advanced modules for specialized testing scenarios. All together, that's 120 powerful scripts designed for security professionals, bug bounty hunters, and penetration testers.

The framework supports web application security testing with scanners for SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, CSRF protection, authentication bypass, file upload vulnerabilities, and more. It includes mobile app security testing for both Android APK and iOS IPA files, covering static analysis, dynamic testing, certificate pinning analysis, and insecure data storage detection. Password security features include strength analysis, common password checking, hash cracking utilities, and breach database lookups.

One feature I'm particularly proud of is the modular architecture. Each tool is independent but can be combined with others through the suite's orchestration layer. This means you can run quick scans with individual tools, or set up comprehensive multi-stage security assessments that chain multiple tools together. The framework includes automation capabilities for running scheduled scans, batch processing multiple targets, and generating comprehensive reports.

The 7 external integrations connect with popular security tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nmap, Metasploit, and others, allowing you to leverage existing workflows while using the suite's unified interface. The 30 utilities cover everything from encoding/decoding data, generating payloads, parsing security headers, analyzing network traffic, to converting between different security data formats.

I built this with a strong emphasis on education and authorized testing only. The framework includes clear legal disclaimers, usage guidelines, and ethical considerations. It's designed for bug bounty programs, authorized penetration testing, security audits on owned infrastructure, and educational research in controlled environments.

The goal was to create a professional-grade security testing framework that's accessible, comprehensive, and ethical. Whether you're a security researcher working on bug bounties, a penetration tester with a signed contract, or a developer securing your own applications, the suite provides the tools you need without the complexity and cost of enterprise solutions.

Available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AbdirahmanNomad/warya-security-suite) as open-source, with comprehensive documentation, usage examples, and active development. The project emphasizes educational use and authorized testing only, with strong legal disclaimers and ethical guidelines.
