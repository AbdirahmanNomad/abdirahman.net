Professional security testing framework with 77 total tools (43 scanners + 30 utilities + 4 advanced modules). 120 powerful scripts covering web applications, mobile apps (APK/IPA), and password security. 36 built-in scanners plus 7 external integrations. Custom algorithms and AI integration for advanced security analysis.

I created the Warya Security Suite because I needed a powerful, comprehensive security testing framework for my own security research and authorized penetration testing work. Most existing tools are either too expensive, too limited, or lack the advanced capabilities I needed for sophisticated security assessments. I wanted something that combined multiple testing methodologies with custom algorithms and AI-powered analysis.

So I built this massive security testing framework with 77 total tools - 120 powerful scripts that I use for professional security work. The suite includes 43 scanners (36 built-in + 7 external integrations) covering everything from web application vulnerabilities to mobile app security. It includes 30 professional utilities for common security tasks, and 4 advanced modules with custom algorithms for specialized testing scenarios. What makes it particularly powerful is the AI integration I built in, which helps with intelligent vulnerability detection, pattern recognition, and automated analysis.

The framework supports web application security testing with scanners for SQL injection, XSS vulnerabilities, CSRF protection, authentication bypass, file upload vulnerabilities, and more. It includes mobile app security testing for both Android APK and iOS IPA files, covering static analysis, dynamic testing, certificate pinning analysis, and insecure data storage detection. Password security features include strength analysis, common password checking, hash cracking utilities, and breach database lookups.

One of the most advanced features is the custom algorithms I developed for specific vulnerability patterns and attack vectors. These aren't just standard scripts - they use machine learning and AI to detect vulnerabilities that traditional tools might miss. The AI integration helps with intelligent payload generation, adaptive scanning strategies, and automated risk assessment that gets smarter over time.

The modular architecture allows me to run quick scans with individual tools, or set up comprehensive multi-stage security assessments that chain multiple tools together. The framework includes automation capabilities for running scheduled scans, batch processing multiple targets, and generating comprehensive reports. The 7 external integrations connect with popular security tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nmap, Metasploit, and others, allowing me to leverage existing workflows while using the suite's unified interface.

Because this framework is so powerful and includes custom algorithms and AI capabilities, I keep it as a local, private project for security reasons. It's designed specifically for my own security research, authorized penetration testing work, bug bounty programs where I have explicit permission, and educational research in controlled environments. The framework includes comprehensive legal disclaimers, usage guidelines, and ethical considerations to ensure it's only used responsibly.

The goal was to create a professional-grade security testing framework that combines the best of traditional tools with advanced custom algorithms and AI capabilities. This is a tool I've built over time for serious security work - it's not a toy, and the power it provides requires responsible use and proper authorization for all testing activities.
