Somali children's books created for the diaspora to learn their language and history. Published on Amazon, featuring traditional stories, folklore, and educational content to keep Somali culture alive for the next generation.

I created these Somali children's books because I wanted Somali diaspora children to learn their language and history. Growing up as part of the Somali diaspora, I saw how difficult it was for children to stay connected to their heritage, especially when they were learning in other languages and growing up far from Somalia.

The reality is that many Somali children in the diaspora lose touch with their language and culture over time. Without resources in Somali, without stories from Somali history and folklore, they miss out on understanding where they come from. I wanted to change that.

So I started creating children's books in Somali that tell traditional stories, share historical events, and teach the language in an engaging way. Books like "[Dhegdheer - Cannibal of the Desert with Long Ears](https://www.amazon.se/Dhegdheer-Cannibal-Desert-Long-Ears/dp/B0D899G38Q)" and "[Cigaal Shidaad - Shadow Scare](https://www.amazon.se/-/en/Cigaal-Shidaad-Shadow-Scare-Abdirahman/dp/B0DSBTTN4L)" bring Somali folklore and stories to life for young readers.

The goal was to create something that Somali parents in the diaspora could use to teach their children - not just vocabulary, but the stories, the history, and the cultural context that make the Somali language meaningful. These aren't just language lessons, they're windows into Somali culture, history, and identity.

Each book is carefully crafted to be both educational and entertaining, written in Somali with cultural context that helps children understand not just what words mean, but why these stories matter. Whether it's traditional folklore, historical events, or cultural practices, the books aim to preserve and pass on Somali heritage to the next generation.

The books are available on Amazon, including [Dhegdheer: The Cannibal of the Desert (Long Ears)](https://www.amazon.se/Dhegdheer-Cannibal-Desert-Long-Ears/dp/B0D899G38Q) and [Cigaal Shidaad and the Shadow Scare](https://www.amazon.se/-/en/Cigaal-Shidaad-Shadow-Scare-Abdirahman/dp/B0DSBTTN4L), making them accessible to Somali families around the world. The goal is to make it easier for diaspora parents to share their culture with their children, and for Somali children everywhere to connect with their roots through stories, language, and history.
