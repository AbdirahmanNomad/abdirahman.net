Digital money transfer service based in Sweden helping people in Europe, especially immigrants, send money to friends and family abroad. Instant transfers, low fees, secure and regulated by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority.

I co-founded TransferGalaxy together with four other co-founders because we saw how difficult and expensive it is for foreigners to send money home. Traditional money transfer services often charge high fees, have slow processing times, and aren't designed with the needs of immigrants and foreign workers in mind. We wanted to build something better.

As one of the five founders, I led our go-to-market strategy and community engagement, building the brand and driving early adoption through trusted networks across Europe and Somalia. My role was unique - I brought media expertise and deep connections to the Somali community in Europe, which proved crucial for getting TransferGalaxy off the ground. I was the one who introduced TransferGalaxy to the world.

Through my background in media production, marketing, and my established presence in the Somali community across Europe, I created campaigns and content that resonated with the exact people TransferGalaxy was designed to help. I knew the community, understood their pain points with existing money transfer services, and knew how to reach them effectively. I used social media, community networks, and word-of-mouth marketing strategies that worked specifically for immigrant communities who value trust and personal connections.

This wasn't just about running ads - it was about building trust within a community that's often overlooked by mainstream financial services. My media expertise helped craft messaging that felt authentic, and my community connections meant people actually listened. I showed them that TransferGalaxy understood their needs because I was part of their community, and I helped build the brand from the ground up through genuine engagement.

So the five of us built TransferGalaxy as a digital money transfer service that operates entirely online via web or mobile app. Users can send money from EU countries and Norway to countries worldwide, with instant or near-instant transfers to mobile wallets or cash pickup points. We handle advertising and marketing, work with financial institutions to process transactions, manage compliance and regulatory requirements, build and maintain the platform technology, and ensure secure payments through SSL encryption and identity verification procedures.

My contribution was making sure the world - especially the immigrant communities across Europe - knew that TransferGalaxy existed and understood how it could help them. Without that connection to communities and media expertise, even the best fintech product would struggle to reach the people it was built for.
