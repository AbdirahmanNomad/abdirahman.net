Digital money transfer service based in Sweden helping people in Europe, especially immigrants, send money to friends and family abroad. Instant transfers, low fees, secure and regulated by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority.

I co-founded TransferGalaxy together with four other co-founders because we saw how difficult and expensive it is for foreigners to send money home. Traditional money transfer services often charge high fees, have slow processing times, and aren't designed with the needs of immigrants and foreign workers in mind. We wanted to build something better.

So the five of us built TransferGalaxy as a digital money transfer service that operates entirely online via web or mobile app. Users can send money from EU countries and Norway to countries worldwide, with instant or near-instant transfers to mobile wallets or cash pickup points.

We handle advertising and marketing, work with financial institutions to process transactions, manage compliance and regulatory requirements, build and maintain the platform technology, and ensure secure payments through SSL encryption and identity verification procedures.
